#Snap

This is a tool that I used it myself almost everyday I work with my iPhone.
It simply downscale @2x.png into .png. Nothing more, nothing less.


## Usage

## License

Icon and sound have been removed from source code repository, since I cannot redistribute them.
Anyway, nice icon bought from http://graphicriver.net/item/stereoscopic-camera-icon/3062840
and the shutter sound from http://audiojungle.net/item/highquality-camera-autofocus-and-shutter/96807

Feel free to do anything with it. Just don't post it on app store, okay?
